        <p class="pt-3"> Nearly 170 million people live in Bangladesh, making it one of the world’s most populous countries and densely populated markets. Bangladesh is also one of the fastest growing economies in the world and has been dubbed the next Asian tiger by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154349613431479/" target="_blank"> World Economic Forum</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21708737-bangladeshs-economy-roll-even-its-democracy-weakens-tiger-night" target="_blank">The Economist</a>, and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bangladesh-is-the-new-asian-tiger-2017-4" target="_blank">others</a>. A dynamic, growing middle class of 40+ million people – 25% of the population – has already propelled Bangladesh to “middle-income” status. As income levels rise, health expenditures increase disproportionately. Middle class families demand and can pay for higher quality services.

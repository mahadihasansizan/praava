        <!-- Dynamic-Content- -->
        <p>Praava Health is building Bangladesh’s fastest-growing consumer healthcare brand. We are raising the bar with a brick-and-click healthcare platform that combines digital tools with meaningful doctor-Patient relationships, quality diagnostics, and pharmacy services. In May 2020, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90492198/world-changing-ideas-awards-2020-asia-pacific-finalists-and-honorable-mentions" target="_blank"> Fast Company recognized Praava Health in its World Changing Ideas Awards</a>. Praava’s work has also been featured by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2018/06/28/sinha/#1cde7e7771f0"> Forbes Magazine</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4838cff6-101d-11e9-acdc-4d9976f1533b " target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sylvana-sinha%3A-leading-the-fastest-growing-healthcare-brand-in-a-fast-growing-economy-2020" target="_blank"> NASDAQ, Tech in Asia</a>, and <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/digital-inclusion-will-be-critical-to-pandemic-recovery-98127" target="_blank">Devex</a>; and Praava won <a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/tiger-challenge-bangladesh" target="_blank">MIT Solve’s Bangladesh Tiger Challenge</a> in 2019. Praava Health was selected by the <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/socialenterprise/socialventures" target="_blank">Tamer Fund for Social Ventures at Columbia Business School</a> as an inaugural portfolio venture and was also selected by <a href="http://alter.global/" target="_blank">Alter Global</a>&nbsp;as one of Bangladesh’s most promising new companies. Praava is a Patient-driven company that aims to be every Patient’s first call, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKnbjdWBIk" target="_blank">seamlessly integrating quality infrastructure with technology to improve efficiency, accessibility, &amp; scalability of the brick &amp; click model</a>.&nbsp;Praava is the combination of the words “praan” (life) and “aava” (beam) -- “beam of life” is a symbolic reflection of what we are building. We aspire to be Bangladesh’s trusted partner in health, empowering Patients to manage their health in a manner aligned with their values. We are a small, impassioned, collaborative team that is inspired to build the best healthcare company in Bangladesh. We seek interns who are excited to help us to build, design, and communicate a new brand and a new concept of healthcare to a new market. </p>

        <p class="pt-3"> Nearly 170 million people live in Bangladesh, making it one of the world’s most populous countries and densely populated markets. Bangladesh is also one of the fastest growing economies in the world and has been dubbed the next Asian tiger by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154349613431479/" target="_blank"> World Economic Forum</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21708737-bangladeshs-economy-roll-even-its-democracy-weakens-tiger-night" target="_blank">The Economist</a>, and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bangladesh-is-the-new-asian-tiger-2017-4" target="_blank">others</a>. A dynamic, growing middle class of 40+ million people – 25% of the population – has already propelled Bangladesh to “middle-income” status. As income levels rise, health expenditures increase disproportionately. Middle class families demand and can pay for higher quality services.
